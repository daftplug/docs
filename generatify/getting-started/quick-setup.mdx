## Step 4: Test & Verify

After enabling your first feature, let's make sure everything is working:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Check API Connection" icon="plug">
    1. Go to **Generatify → Settings → Integrations**
    2. Look for a **green checkmark** next to your AI provider
    3. If you see a red X, double-check your API key

    <img src="/images/api-status.png" alt="API Connection Status" />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Test the Feature" icon="flask">
    Follow the specific test instructions for the feature you enabled:
    - **Chatbot:** Open the chat and ask a question
    - **Auto Tags:** Create/update a post without tags
    - **Helpdesk:** Visit your site's front-end and use the chat
    - **Toxicity Checker:** Try submitting a test comment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Most AI providers have usage dashboards:
    - **OpenAI:** [platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
    - **Anthropic:** [console.anthropic.com/settings/usage](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage)
    - **Google:** [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)

    Check your usage to ensure API calls are being made successfully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Review Error Logs" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If something isn't working:
    1. Enable WordPress debug mode
    2. Check `/wp-content/debug.log`

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to choose just one AI provider?">
    No! You can connect multiple AI providers and assign different models to different features. For example:
    - Use GPT-4 for your AI Assistant (most powerful)
    - Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for auto-tagging (faster, cheaper)
    - Use Claude for helpdesk (great at conversation)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much will AI API calls cost?">
    It depends on your usage, but most features cost just fractions of a cent per action:
    - **Auto tags:** ~$0.001 per post
    - **Chatbot message:** ~$0.01 - $0.05 per conversation
    - **Helpdesk response:** ~$0.01 - $0.03 per question

    Most sites spend $5-20/month total. Monitor your provider's dashboard to track exact costs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Generatify without API keys?">
    Some features like **Toxicity Checker** and **Alt Image Detection** work entirely client-side using TensorFlow.js and don't require API keys. However, most features require an AI provider connection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data sent to AI providers?">
    Yes, when you use AI features, relevant content (post text, user questions, etc.) is sent to your chosen AI provider for processing. Data is sent securely via HTTPS. No data is stored by Generatify itself—everything goes directly to your AI provider.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I enable all features at once?">
    Yes! You can enable as many features as you want. Each module operates independently. Just keep in mind that more features = more API calls = higher costs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
