## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Submits Comment">
    Visitor writes and submits a comment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="TensorFlow.js Analysis">
    AI analyzes text in browser using toxicity model
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Toxicity Scoring">
    Assigns scores for 7 toxicity categories (0-100%)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Decision">
    Based on thresholds: Approve, Hold for review, or Block
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User Feedback">
    Shows appropriate message to commenter
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Privacy First:** Analysis happens in the user's browser. Comments are never sent to external AI services.

## Toxicity Categories

AI detects 7 types of harmful content:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Toxicity**</td>
      <td>General rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable content</td>
      <td>"You're an idiot", "This is garbage"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Severe Toxicity**</td>
      <td>Very hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful</td>
      <td>Extreme insults, threats</td>
    </tr>

## False Positives

AI isn't perfect. Handle false positives:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Moderation Queue" icon="list-check">
    **Regularly check held comments:**
    
    ```
    WordPress Admin → Comments → Pending
    
    Look for:
    - Legitimate comments mistakenly flagged
    - Context AI missed
    - Sarcasm/humor misunderstood
    ```
    
    **Action:**
    - Approve false positives
    - Note patterns
    - Adjust thresholds if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Whitelist Trusted Users" icon="user-check">
    **Skip checking for approved users:**
    
    ```
    Settings → Toxicity Checker → Exceptions
    
    ✅ Skip checking for:
    - Administrators
    - Editors
    - Authors
    - Approved commenters (X+ comments)
    ```
    
    **Best Practice:** Skip checking after user has 3+ approved comments
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Adjust Thresholds" icon="sliders">
    **If too many false positives:**
    
    1. Review blocked/held comments
    2. Identify which category triggered
    3. Increase threshold for that category
    4. Test with sample comments
    5. Iterate until balanced
    
    **Example:**
    "Damn, this is good!" flagged for Profanity
    → Increase Profanity threshold from 70% to 80%
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Context Keyword Allowlist" icon="spell-check">
    **Allow specific words in context:**
    
    ```
    Settings → Toxicity Checker → Allowlist
    
    Examples:
    - "damn" (in certain contexts)
    - "hell" (as in "what the hell is this about")
    - Technical terms that trigger false positives
    ```
    
    **Use Sparingly:** Allowlist reduces effectiveness
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
**AI Isn't Perfect:** Understand these limitations
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Challenges" icon="message-question">
    **AI may miss:**
    - Sarcasm ("Oh great, another tutorial" - sarcastic, not toxic)
    - Cultural nuances
    - Inside jokes
    - Regional slang
    
    **Solution:** Human moderation review for borderline cases
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Language Support" icon="language">
    **Currently supports:**
    - English only
    
    **Coming soon:**
    - Spanish
    - French
    - German
    - More languages

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sophisticated Trolls" icon="user-secret">
    **Won't catch:**
    - Coded language
    - Dog whistles
    - Subtle harassment
    - Coordinated attacks
    
    **Solution:** Combine with human moderation and community reporting
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Balanced Settings" icon="balance-scale">
    Don't go too strict initially:
    
    1. Enable with "Balanced" preset
    2. Set action to "Hold for Moderation" (not Block)
    3. Monitor for 1-2 weeks
    4. Review false positive rate
    5. Adjust thresholds based on data
    6. Gradually tune to your needs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Communicate with Users" icon="bullhorn">
    Be transparent about moderation:
    
    **Add to Comment Guidelines:**
    ```
    "Comments are automatically screened for inappropriate content. 
    If your comment is held for moderation, please be patient while 
    we review it. We aim to approve comments within 24 hours."
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Sets expectations
    - Reduces frustration
    - Explains delays
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with Human Moderation" icon="users">
    **Hybrid Approach (Best):**
    
    - AI: First line of defense (catches 80-90%)
    - Humans: Final decision (reviews borderline 10-20%)
    
    **Workflow:**
    1. AI blocks obvious toxicity
    2. AI holds borderline cases
    3. Moderator reviews held comments daily
    4. Approves legitimate, rejects toxic
    5. Learns from patterns, adjusts thresholds
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Toxicity Checker Not Working">
    **Possible Causes:**
    1. Feature not enabled
    2. JavaScript disabled/blocked
    3. Old browser
    4. TensorFlow.js model failed to load
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify enabled in Settings
    2. Check browser console for errors
    3. Test in Chrome/Firefox (latest)
    4. Check internet connection
    5. Try clearing browser cache
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too Many False Positives">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Switch from Strict to Balanced
    2. Increase thresholds by 10-20%
    3. Review which category triggers most
    4. Add common false positives to allowlist
    5. Whitelist trusted commenters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Toxic Comments Still Getting Through">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Lower thresholds (more sensitive)
    2. Switch to Strict preset
    3. Review which category they fall under
    4. Check if users are circumventing (l33tspeak)
    5. Add human moderation for all comments
  </Accordion>
