## Why Alt Text Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accessibility (Most Important)" icon="universal-access">
    Alt text describes images for:
    - Screen readers for visually impaired users
    - Users with images disabled
    - Slow connections where images don't load
    
    **Legal Requirement:** ADA and WCAG guidelines require alt text for accessibility compliance.
    
    **Impact:** Makes your content accessible to 2.2 billion people worldwide with vision impairment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SEO Benefits" icon="chart-line">
    Google uses alt text to:
    - Understand image content
    - Rank images in Google Images
    - Understand page context
    - Generate rich snippets
    
    **Result:** Better rankings in both web and image search results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Better UX" icon="face-smile">
    Alt text appears when:
    - Images fail to load
    - Broken image links
    - Slow connections
    - Browser extensions block images
    
    **Benefit:** Users still understand your content.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="It's Time-Consuming" icon="clock">
    Writing alt text manually:
    - 30-60 seconds per image
    - Easy to forget
    - Requires attention to detail
    - Boring and repetitive
    
    **Solution:** Automate it with AI!
  </Accordion>

## Local vs. Cloud AI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local (TensorFlow.js)">
    ### Browser-Based Analysis
    
    **How It Works:**
    - TensorFlow.js runs in user's browser
    - Uses pre-trained image recognition model
    - Identifies common objects, scenes, colors
    
    **Pros:**
    - ✅ Completely free (no API costs)
    - ✅ Privacy-friendly (images never uploaded)
    - ✅ Fast processing
    - ✅ Works offline
    - ✅ No API quotas
    
    **Cons:**
    - ⚠️ Limited to common objects/scenes
    - ⚠️ Less detailed descriptions
    - ⚠️ Requires modern browser
    
    **Best For:**
    - Standard blog images
    - Product photos
    - Stock photography
    - Budget-conscious users
    
    **Example Output:**
    ```
    "Person sitting at desk with laptop computer"
    "Red sports car on mountain road"
    "Chocolate cake with strawberries on white plate"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cloud AI (GPT-4 Vision)">
    ### Advanced Image Understanding
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Images sent to OpenAI GPT-4 Vision
    - Deep learning analyzes complex scenes
    - Understands context, emotions, relationships
    
    **Pros:**
    - ✅ Highly detailed descriptions
    - ✅ Understands complex scenes
    - ✅ Contextual awareness
    - ✅ Better for unique images
    - ✅ Recognizes brand logos, text in images
    
    **Cons:**
    - ⚠️ Costs ~$0.01-0.02 per image
    - ⚠️ Requires internet connection
    - ⚠️ Slower than local
    - ⚠️ Images uploaded to AI provider
    
    **Best For:**
    - Complex photography
    - Infographics
    - Screenshots with text
    - Unique/artistic images
    
    **Example Output:**
    ```
    "Professional woman in business attire presenting data 
    visualization on large screen to team of colleagues in 
    modern office conference room"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach (Recommended)">
    ### Best of Both Worlds
    
    **Strategy:**
    - Use TensorFlow.js by default (free)
    - Fallback to Cloud AI for:
      - Featured images (most important)
      - Images with text (infographics)
      - Complex scenes
      - User-specified important images
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Default: Local TensorFlow.js
    Featured Images: GPT-4 Vision
    Confidence < 70%: Fallback to GPT-4 Vision
    ```
    
    **Cost:**
    - 95% of images: FREE (local)
    - 5% of images: $0.01 (cloud)
    - Average: ~$0.0005 per image
    
    **Result:** Best quality where it matters, minimal cost overall.

## Alt Text Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Descriptive but Concise" icon="align-left">
    **Goal:** Describe the image in 1-2 sentences
    
    **Good Examples:**
    ```
    ✅ "Golden retriever puppy playing with tennis ball in green grass"
    ✅ "Bar chart showing website traffic growth from January to June"
    ✅ "Woman typing on MacBook at coffee shop"
    ```
    
    **Bad Examples:**
    ```
    ❌ "Image"
    ❌ "photo.jpg"
    ❌ "This is an image of a really cute golden retriever puppy 
       that looks to be about 3 months old playing with a yellow 
       tennis ball in some very green grass on what appears to be 
       a sunny summer day..."
    ```
    
    **Guideline:** 50-125 characters is ideal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't Say 'Image of' or 'Picture of'" icon="times">
    Screen readers already announce "image," so don't repeat it.
    
    **Examples:**
    ```
    ❌ "Image of sunset over ocean"
    ✅ "Sunset over ocean with orange and pink clouds"
    
    ❌ "Picture showing laptop on desk"
    ✅ "MacBook Pro on wooden desk with coffee mug"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Context When Relevant" icon="context">
    Consider what the image is meant to convey in context.
    
    **Example: Blog Post About Remote Work**
    
    Generic alt text:
    ```
    ❌ "Person using laptop"
    ```
    
    Contextual alt text:
    ```
    ✅ "Remote worker on video call from home office"
    ```
    
    **How Generatify Helps:** AI analyzes post content to understand context.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Decorative Images Should Have Empty Alt" icon="wand-sparkles">
    Purely decorative images (dividers, backgrounds) should have empty alt text:
    
    ```html
    <img src="divider.png" alt="">
    ```
    
    **Why:** Screen readers will skip them, avoiding clutter.
    
    **Generatify Auto-Detects:**
    - Small images (< 50x50px)
    - Images named "divider," "separator," "decoration"
    - Images in decorative CSS classes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't Keyword Stuff" icon="warning">
    Alt text is for accessibility, not SEO manipulation.
    
    **Bad Example:**
    ```
    ❌ "Best running shoes 2024 running shoes for men women kids 
       buy running shoes cheap running shoes Nike Adidas running shoes"
    ```
    
    **Good Example:**
    ```
    ✅ "Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40 running shoes in black and white"
    ```
    
    **Guideline:** Include relevant keywords naturally, but prioritize description.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost Estimation (Cloud AI)

If using GPT-4 Vision for image analysis:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Image Size</th>
      <th>Cost per Image</th>
      <th>100 Images</th>
      <th>1,000 Images</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Low detail</td>
      <td>$0.01</td>
      <td>$1.00</td>
      <td>$10.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>High detail</td>
      <td>$0.02</td>
      <td>$2.00</td>
      <td>$20.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Cost Comparison

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
      <th>Quality</th>
      <th>Best For</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Manual writing</td>
      <td>$0 (but 30-60 sec/image)</td>
      <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</td>
      <td>Critical images only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Local AI (TensorFlow.js)</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>⭐⭐⭐</td>
      <td>Standard images</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloud AI (GPT-4 Vision)</td>
      <td>$0.01-0.02</td>
      <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</td>
      <td>Complex/important images</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

    **Solutions:**
    1. Switch to Cloud AI (GPT-4 Vision)
    2. Ensure images are high quality
