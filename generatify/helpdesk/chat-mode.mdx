## Conversation Flow

### Multi-Turn Conversations

AI maintains context across messages:

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Do you have running shoes?"
AI: "Yes! We have several running shoe options. Are you looking 
     for men's or women's?"

User: "Women's"
AI: "Great! We have 5 women's running shoe models ranging from $79 
     to $149. Are you looking for neutral cushioning or stability 
     support?"

User: "What's the difference?"
AI: "Neutral cushioning shoes are best for runners with normal gait, 
     while stability shoes provide extra support for overpronation. 
     If you're unsure, our neutral models like the CloudRunner are 
     popular choices. Would you like to see them?"

User: "Yes please"
AI: "Perfect! Here's the CloudRunner Women's: [product link]. 
     It features lightweight foam, breathable mesh, and is $89. 
     Available in 6 colors. Need help with sizing?"
