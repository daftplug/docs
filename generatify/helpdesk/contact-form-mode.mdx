## When to Use Contact Form Mode

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Primary Form (No AI)">
    ### Use as Main Support Method
    
    **Best For:**
    - Budget-conscious sites
    - Low-traffic websites
    - Prefer human-only support
    - No AI provider available
    - Privacy-sensitive industries
    
    **Pros:**
    - ✅ Zero ongoing costs
    - ✅ Complete privacy control
    - ✅ Simple, proven solution
    - ✅ No API dependencies
    
    **Cons:**
    - ⚠️ No instant responses
    - ⚠️ Requires manual replies
    - ⚠️ Limited scalability
    
    **Ideal For:** Personal blogs, portfolio sites, small businesses
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid with AI">
    ### AI + Contact Form Fallback
    
    **Best For:**
    - Most websites (recommended)
    - Balancing automation + human touch
    - Complex products requiring human support
    - 24/7 AI + human business hours
    
    **How It Works:**
    1. AI handles 70-80% of questions instantly
    2. Complex issues escalate to contact form
    3. User can choose form anytime
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Enable both:
    ✅ AI Chat Mode (primary)
    ✅ Contact Form Mode (fallback)
    
    Show "Talk to human" button in AI chat footer
    ```
    
    **Result:** Best of both worlds - automation + personal touch
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Business Hours Only">
    ### Form During Off-Hours
    
    **Best For:**
    - Sites with defined business hours
    - Live chat available sometimes
    - Cost-conscious approach
    
    **How It Works:**
    ```
    During business hours (9am-5pm):
    - AI Chat Mode enabled
    
    Outside business hours:
    - Contact Form Mode only
    - "We'll reply within 24 hours"
    ```
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Settings → Helpdesk → Display Rules → Time-Based
    
    Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST: AI Chat
    All other times: Contact Form
    ```
    
    **Result:** AI costs only during peak hours
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## SMTP Configuration (Recommended)

WordPress default email is unreliable. Use SMTP for guaranteed delivery:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install SMTP Plugin">
    Recommended: **WP Mail SMTP** (free)
    
    ```
    Plugins → Add New → Search "WP Mail SMTP" → Install → Activate
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose SMTP Provider">
    Options:
    - Gmail (free, 500/day limit)
    - SendGrid (100/day free, then paid)
    - Mailgun (5,000/month free, then paid)
    - Amazon SES (cheapest for high volume)
    - Your web host's SMTP
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure SMTP Settings">
    Example for Gmail:
    ```
    SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
    Encryption: TLS
    Port: 587
    Username: your-email@gmail.com
    Password: [App-specific password]
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Test Email">
    WP Mail SMTP → Tools → Email Test → Send
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Delivery">
    Check inbox (and spam folder)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Gmail Security:** Use App-Specific Password, not your main Gmail password. Enable 2FA and generate app password in Google Account settings.
</Warning>

## Spam Protection

Prevent spam submissions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google reCAPTCHA" icon="robot">
    **Most Effective:** Stops 99% of spam
    
    **Setup:**
    1. Get reCAPTCHA keys: [google.com/recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha)
    2. Choose v2 (checkbox) or v3 (invisible)
    3. Add keys to Generatify settings
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Settings → Helpdesk → Contact Form → Spam Protection
    
    ✅ Enable reCAPTCHA
    Version: v2 Checkbox (v3 Invisible for better UX)
    Site Key: [Your site key]
    Secret Key: [Your secret key]
    ```
    
    **Pros:** Very effective, trusted
    **Cons:** Extra step for users (v2), Google dependency
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Honeypot Field" icon="honey-pot">
    **Invisible to humans, visible to bots**
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Hidden field added to form (CSS display: none)
    - Humans can't see it, don't fill it
    - Bots fill all fields, including hidden one
    - Submissions with honeypot filled = spam
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Settings → Helpdesk → Contact Form → Spam Protection
    
    ✅ Enable honeypot field
    Field name: "website_url" (looks legitimate to bots)
    ```
    
    **Pros:** No user friction, free, privacy-friendly
    **Cons:** Less effective than reCAPTCHA (stops ~70% of spam)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Time-Based Validation" icon="clock">
    **Reject submissions that are too fast**
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Track when form is opened
    - Reject if submitted in < 3 seconds (bots are fast)
    - Legitimate users need time to type
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Settings → Helpdesk → Contact Form → Spam Protection
    
    ✅ Minimum time before submit
    Minimum: 3 seconds
    ```
    
    **Pros:** No user impact, effective against simple bots
    **Cons:** Won't stop sophisticated bots
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Akismet Integration" icon="shield-halved">
    **WordPress anti-spam service**
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Akismet checks submissions against spam database
    - Learns from millions of sites
    - Blocks known spammers
    
    **Setup:**
    1. Install Akismet plugin
    2. Get API key from akismet.com
    3. Enable in Generatify
    
    **Cost:** Free for personal, $5-50/mo for business
    
    **Pros:** Very effective, learns over time
    **Cons:** Requires account, costs money for business
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Recommended Spam Protection

**Best Setup:**
```
✅ reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible, no user friction)
✅ Honeypot field (backup protection)
✅ Time-based validation (3 second minimum)
⬜ Akismet (only if spam still gets through)

Result: 99.9% spam blocked, minimal user friction
```
