## Trigger Settings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto (After Pause)">
    ### Automatic Suggestions
    
    **How It Works:**
    - You stop typing for 1-2 seconds
    - AI generates suggestion automatically
    - Appears as gray text
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Trigger: After pause
    Delay: 1 second (1-5 seconds)
    ```
    
    **Best For:** Fast writers, continuous flow
    
    **Pros:**
    - ✅ Seamless experience
    - ✅ No manual action needed
    - ✅ Natural writing flow
    
    **Cons:**
    - ⚠️ May interrupt thinking
    - ⚠️ Higher AI costs (more suggestions)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="After X Words">
    ### Word Count Trigger
    
    **How It Works:**
    - AI suggests every 20-50 words
    - Helps maintain consistent pacing
    - Less frequent than auto-pause
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Trigger: After word count
    Words: 30 words
    ```
    
    **Best For:** Long-form content, thoughtful writing
    
    **Pros:**
    - ✅ Less intrusive
    - ✅ Lower AI costs
    - ✅ Predictable timing
    
    **Cons:**
    - ⚠️ May miss natural pause points
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual (Keyboard Shortcut)">
    ### On-Demand Suggestions
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Press Ctrl+Space (or custom shortcut)
    - AI generates suggestion only when asked
    - Full control over when to use AI
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```
    Trigger: Manual
    Shortcut: Ctrl+Space
    ```
    
    **Best For:** Cost-conscious, selective use
    
    **Pros:**
    - ✅ Complete control
    - ✅ Lowest AI costs
    - ✅ Use only when stuck
    
    **Cons:**
    - ⚠️ Breaks flow to trigger manually
    - ⚠️ Easy to forget to use
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Writing Style Adaptation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match My Style (Recommended)" icon="fingerprint">
    AI learns from your existing content.
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Analyzes your last 10-20 posts
    - Learns vocabulary, sentence structure, tone
    - Mimics your writing patterns
    
    **Result:** Suggestions sound like you wrote them
    
    **Example:**
    If you write casually with contractions and shorter sentences, AI will too.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Professional" icon="briefcase">
    Formal, business-appropriate tone.
    
    **Characteristics:**
    - Formal language
    - Complete sentences
    - No contractions
    - Technical vocabulary
    
    **Best For:** Corporate blogs, B2B content, whitepapers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Casual" icon="comments">
    Conversational, friendly tone.
    
    **Characteristics:**
    - Contractions (you'll, we're)
    - Shorter sentences
    - Relatable language
    - Personal pronouns (you, we)
    
    **Best For:** Lifestyle blogs, social content, newsletters
  </Accordion>
