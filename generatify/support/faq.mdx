    **1. OpenAI (ChatGPT)**
    - Models: GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-3.5 Turbo
    - Best for: General-purpose, well-documented
    - Cost: $0.15 - $30 per 1M tokens
    
    **2. Anthropic (Claude)**
    - Models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku, Claude 3 Opus/Haiku

    - Best for: Cost-effectiveness, multimodal (future)
    - Cost: Free tier available, then $0.075 - $7 per 1M tokens
    
    You can switch providers or use multiple providers with automatic fallback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much does AI usage cost?" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Typical monthly costs for a small-medium blog (20 posts/month):**
    
    - **Automations (tags, categories, meta):** $1-3/month
    - **Chat widget (200 conversations):** $5-15/month
    - **Smart Compose (500 suggestions):** $2-5/month
    - **Related Posts (with caching):** <$1/month
    - **Toxicity Checker:** $0 (uses TensorFlow.js)
    
    **Total estimated:** $8-25/month
    
    **For larger sites (100 posts/month, 1,000 chats):**
    - $40-100/month
    
    **Cost optimization tips:**
    - Use GPT-4o Mini (97% cheaper than GPT-4)
    - Enable caching (99% cost reduction for repeated content)
    - Set rate limits per user
    - Use Gemini Flash (free tier: 15 requests/minute)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay for Generatify AND the AI provider?" icon="money-bill">
    **Yes, two separate costs:**
    
    1. **Generatify Plugin License** (one-time or subscription)
       - Access to plugin updates and support
       
    2. **AI Provider API Costs** (pay-as-you-go)
       - You pay the AI provider directly based on usage
       - No markup from Generatify
       - You keep full control of your AI spending
    
    This gives you:
    - Transparent pricing
    - No vendor lock-in
    - Direct access to AI providers
    - Ability to switch providers anytime
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use Generatify without an AI API key?" icon="key">
    **Partially:**
    
    **Features that work without AI:**
    - Toxicity Checker (uses TensorFlow.js locally)
    - Manual controls and UI
    
    **Features that require AI API:**
    - Chat assistant
    - Automations (tags, categories, meta descriptions)
    - Helpdesk agent
    - Smart Compose
    - Related Posts recommendations
    
    **Recommendation:** Get at least one AI provider API key to unlock full potential.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of API credits?" icon="gauge">
    **If your AI provider API limit is reached:**
    
    1. AI features stop working temporarily
    2. Users see friendly error message
    3. You receive email notification (if configured)
    4. Cached responses still work
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add payment method to AI provider account
    - Increase spending limits
    - Enable fallback provider
    - Optimize usage (caching, rate limits)
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Set budget alerts at 80%
    - Enable caching
    - Use GPT-4o Mini for most features
    - Set per-user rate limits
  </Accordion>
