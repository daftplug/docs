## What is the AI Assistant Chatbot?

The AI Assistant Chatbot is your personal WordPress copilot—a context-aware AI that understands your entire site's content, plugins, themes, and configuration. It helps you write content, troubleshoot errors, answer questions, and manage your site more efficiently.

## Advanced Features

### Conversation History

The AI Assistant maintains conversation context within each session:

- Ask follow-up questions without repeating context
- Reference previous responses
- Build on earlier suggestions
- Context persists until you close the chat

<Note>
  **Privacy:** Conversation history is stored locally in your browser and cleared when you close the chatbot. It's never saved to your database unless you explicitly enable chat history logging.
</Note>

### Context Documents

Attach relevant context to your queries:

1. Click the **Add Context** button
2. Select posts, pages, or other content
3. The AI will reference these documents when responding
4. Remove context items when no longer needed

<img src="/images/context-documents.png" alt="Adding context documents" />

### System Instructions

Customize how the AI responds:

```
Examples of custom instructions:
- "Always respond in a professional, corporate tone"
- "Keep responses under 200 words"
- "Use British English spelling"
- "Format code examples with proper syntax highlighting"
- "Include sources and citations when possible"
```

Set custom instructions in **Generatify → Chatbot → System Instructions**.

### Model Selection

Switch between AI models mid-conversation:

- **GPT-4 Turbo** - Complex tasks, highest quality
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo** - Quick responses, cost-effective
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Natural conversation, safety
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Fast, budget-friendly
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** - Long context, multimodal
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash** - Ultra-fast responses

<Tip>
  Use faster, cheaper models for simple queries and save premium models for complex tasks to optimize costs.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    **Good:** "Write a 500-word blog post about WordPress caching plugins, comparing W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache. Include pros, cons, and recommendations."

    **Bad:** "Tell me about caching"

    Specific prompts yield better results. Include details about length, tone, format, and context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide Context" icon="layer-group">
    When asking about your site:
    - Mention specific posts/pages
    - Reference error messages exactly
    - Include relevant settings or configurations
    - Attach context documents when helpful

    Example: "Analyze my post titled 'Getting Started with WordPress' and suggest SEO improvements"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate and Refine" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Don't expect perfection on the first try:
    1. Start with a general request
    2. Review the AI's response
    3. Ask for modifications
    4. Refine until satisfied

    Example conversation:
    - "Write a product description for my WordPress hosting service"
    - "Make it more technical and include performance metrics"
    - "Great, now make it shorter—under 100 words"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Information" icon="shield-check">
    The AI is powerful but not infallible:
    - Double-check facts and statistics
    - Test code before deploying to production
    - Verify plugin/theme recommendations
    - Review content for accuracy

    Treat AI output as a **draft** that needs human review.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Costs" icon="dollar-sign">
    AI API calls cost money:
    - Use cheaper models for simple tasks
    - Keep conversations focused
    - Avoid unnecessary context
    - Set usage alerts in your AI provider dashboard

    See our [Cost Optimization Guide](/advanced/performance) for more tips.
