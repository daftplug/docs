## Overview

The Content Moderation module uses AI to detect and block toxic, hateful, or abusive comments before they're submitted—protecting your community and reducing moderation workload.

<Check>
  **Free Feature:** Content Moderation uses TensorFlow.js and runs entirely in the browser. No API key or external service required!
</Check>

## How It Works

### Real-time Analysis

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Writes Comment">
    Visitor types a comment in your comment form
  </Step>

  <Step title="Client-Side Analysis">
    TensorFlow.js analyzes the text in the browser (no server request)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toxicity Detection">
    AI model scores text across multiple categories:
    - Toxicity
    - Severe Toxicity
    - Identity Attack
    - Insult
    - Profanity
    - Threat
    - Sexual Content (explicit)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Threshold Check">
    If any score exceeds your threshold, submission is blocked
  </Step>

  <Step title="User Feedback">
    Warning message explains why comment was blocked
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Privacy-First Design

- ✅ **No data sent to servers** - everything runs in browser
- ✅ **No API calls** - completely free
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - works offline
- ✅ **GDPR compliant** - no data collection

## Understanding Thresholds

The toxicity model returns a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each category:

- **0.0 - 0.3:** Low confidence (likely not toxic)
- **0.3 - 0.7:** Medium confidence (possibly toxic)
- **0.7 - 1.0:** High confidence (very likely toxic)

### Recommended Thresholds

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Lenient (0.9)">
    **Best for:** Adult communities, casual forums

    Only blocks extremely obvious toxicity. May allow some borderline content through.

    **Use when:**
    - Community is self-moderating
    - You want minimal false positives
    - Content guidelines are relaxed
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Balanced (0.7)">
    **Best for:** Most websites (recommended default)

    Blocks clearly toxic content while minimizing false positives.

    **Use when:**
    - You want good protection without being overly strict
    - Standard community guidelines apply
    - Balancing safety and free expression
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Strict (0.5)">
    **Best for:** Family-friendly sites, children's content

    Aggressively blocks anything remotely toxic. May have more false positives.

    **Use when:**
    - Audience includes children
    - Zero tolerance for negativity
    - High moderation standards required
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Very Strict (0.3)">
    **Best for:** Educational sites, sensitive topics

    Maximum protection. Will block many borderline cases.

    **Use when:**
    - Content is highly sensitive
    - Community has strict conduct rules
    - You prefer manual review of blocked comments
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Customizing Warning Messages

When a comment is blocked, users see a warning message. Customize it to match your tone:

### Default Message

```
Your comment contains language that may be harmful or offensive. 
Please revise your comment to be more respectful and constructive.
```

### Custom Message Examples

<CodeGroup>
```text Professional
Thank you for your feedback. However, your comment doesn't meet our community guidelines. Please rephrase your message to be more constructive and respectful.
```

```text Friendly
Hey there! 👋 We noticed your comment might contain language that could be hurtful to others. Mind rephrasing it in a friendlier way? Thanks for keeping our community positive!
```

```text Educational
Our community values respectful dialogue. The language in your comment may be harmful. Consider rephrasing to contribute constructively to the discussion. Check our Community Guidelines for more info.
```

```text Strict
Comment blocked. This content violates our zero-tolerance policy on toxic language. Repeated violations may result in restricted access.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Message Variables

Use these variables in your message:

- `{category}` - Which category triggered the block (e.g., "Toxicity", "Insult")
- `{score}` - The confidence score (e.g., "0.85")
- `{guidelines_url}` - Link to your community guidelines

Example:
```
Your comment was flagged for {category} (confidence: {score}). 
Please review our [Community Guidelines]({guidelines_url}) and try again.
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Per-Category Thresholds

Set different thresholds for each category:

<img src="/images/moderation-advanced.png" alt="Advanced Threshold Settings" />

```
Toxicity: 0.7

```

### Bypass Rules

Allow certain users or roles to bypass moderation:

- **Administrators:** Always bypass
- **Editors:** Optional bypass
- **Authors:** Optional bypass
- **Logged-in users:** Optional bypass

<Warning>
  Be cautious with bypass rules. Even trusted users can occasionally post toxic content accidentally.
</Warning>

### Form Targeting

Apply toxicity checking to specific forms:

- ✅ **Comment forms** (default)
- ✅ **Contact forms** (optional)
- ✅ **Review forms** (WooCommerce, etc.)
- ✅ **Forum posts** (bbPress, BuddyPress)

## Performance & Compatibility

### Browser Support

TensorFlow.js works in all modern browsers:

- ✅ Chrome 57+
- ✅ Firefox 52+
- ✅ Safari 11+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

<Info>
  For older browsers, the feature gracefully degrades—comments submit normally without toxicity checking.

### Performance Impact

- **Model size:** ~4MB (loaded once, cached)
- **Analysis time:** 100-500ms per comment
- **CPU usage:** Minimal (runs on user's device)
- **No server load:** Everything is client-side

### Compatibility

Works with:
- ✅ Default WordPress comments

## Limitations & Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="False Positives" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    AI isn't perfect. Occasionally, innocent comments may be flagged:

    **Example false positives:**
    - Quoting toxic content to discuss it
    - Satire or sarcasm
    - Medical/scientific terms
    - Reclaimed language within communities

    **Solutions:**
    - Adjust thresholds
    - Add bypass rules for trusted users
    - Provide clear appeal process
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="False Negatives" icon="eye-slash">
    Sophisticated toxic content may slip through:

    **Examples:**
    - Coded language
    - Implicit bias
    - Context-dependent toxicity
    - Misspelled slurs (intentional)

    **Solutions:**
    - Use stricter thresholds
    - Combine with manual moderation
    - Implement reporting system
    - Regular review of flagged content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Language Support" icon="language">
    The toxicity model is trained primarily on **English**. Support for other languages is limited and less accurate.

    **Well-supported:** English

    **Partial support:** Spanish, French, German, Portuguese

    **Limited support:** Other languages

    For non-English sites, consider:
    - Testing thoroughly before deploying
    - Using more lenient thresholds
    - Combining with language-specific tools
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context Awareness" icon="brain">
    The model analyzes text in isolation, without full context:

    - Can't detect sarcasm reliably
    - Doesn't understand relationships between commenters
    - May miss context-dependent toxicity
    - Can't assess tone or intent accurately

    AI moderation should complement, not replace, human judgment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
